Top-algorithm-set is a tool-set of data mining algorithm.If you are a java developer,you don't have to learn Python and other complex frameworks. You can use this tool-set in your java project.In this tool-set we provide BP-NeuralNetwork algorithm ,KNN and a matrix class now.You can use BP-NeuralNetwork(BPNN) to create BPNN models and make predictions.We will release other common algorithms.If you have any questions or suggestions,please tell me.

## Top-algorithm-set Goals

- Provide a flexible, portable and simple way of data mining.
- Provide matrix support.
